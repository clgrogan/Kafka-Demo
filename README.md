## Project Specifications

Build a small application writing records to Kafka with a KafkaProducer. Use the Confluent Cloud service to host the Environment and Cluster.

## Tech Notes

- The configuration files are not included in the Git repository. The Kafka tutorial referenced in the acknowledgements provides guidance on how to set up the configuration files.
- The tutorial was out of date slightly when I created this application. There must be a "settings.gradle" file in the application (typically at the root directory) for newer versions of Gradle in order to build the application. For single project builds the file may be empty.
